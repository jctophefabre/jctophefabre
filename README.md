# 👋 Hi, I'm Jean-Christophe 🧑‍💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jctophefabre/jctophefabre/master/jctophefabre_card.png">

I am a software engineer with a passion for well-designed and well-coded software, with a software craftsmanship approach.  

I worked for more than twenty years in a research lab for better understanding of environmental issues in agriculture 🌱, where I created, developed and leaded [a software platform for spatial modelling and simulation](https://www.openfluid-project.org/).  
I am now leading a terrific team who develop a software engine for AAA video games in a major company. I enjoy building and developing teams for creating innovative and powerful software architectures.<br/>

...and many others great activities 👟 🚴 🚵‍♂️ 🏔 ⛷ 🎸 🎧 😁
