# 👋 Hi, I'm Jean-Christophe 🧑‍💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jctophefabre/jctophefabre/master/jctophefabre_card.png">

I am a software engineer with a passion for well-designed and well-coded software, with a software craftsmanship approach.  

I work in a research lab for better understanding of environmental issues in agriculture 🌱. I am leading the development of [a software platform for spatial modelling and simulation](https://www.openfluid-project.org/). I enjoy creating innovative software architectures, using and contributing to open source projects. The main technologies I work with are C++, Python, [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), Git, ... but also with web technologies such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and much more.

...and one more thing...  🎸 🎧 🏔 ⛷ 🏉 🎾 👟 ⛵
