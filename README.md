I am a sofware engineer who is working in a research lab for better understanding of environmental issues in agriculture 🌱.<br/>
I am leading the development of [a software platform for spatial modelling](https://www.openfluid-project.org/). I enjoy creating innovative software architectures, using and contributing to open source developments. Main technologies I work with are C++, Python, [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), Git, ... but also with web technologies such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and much more.
