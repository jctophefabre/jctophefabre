# 👋 Hi, I'm Jean-Christophe 🧑‍💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jctophefabre/jctophefabre/master/jctophefabre_card.png">

I am a software engineer with a passion for well-designed and well-coded software, with a software craftsmanship approach.  

I work in a research lab for better understanding of environmental issues in agriculture 🌱. I am the team leader and lead developer of [a software platform for spatial modelling and simulation](https://www.openfluid-project.org/). I enjoy creating innovative software architectures for complex systems, using and contributing to open source projects. The main technologies I work with are [C++](https://isocpp.org/), [Boost](https://www.boost.org/), [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and much more. I also design REST APIs and web apps involving technologies such as [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

...and many others great activities 👟 🚴 🚵‍♂️ 🏔 ⛷ 🎸 🎧 😁
